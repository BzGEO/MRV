title: Response design
summary: In this tutorial, we will determine reference conditions by examining a set of reference data at locations of the units of the sample that we drew from Colombia in the previous tutorial. We defined four strata (forest, non-forest, forest disturbance) and a buffer around the forest disturbance. The objective is to estimate the area of forest disturbance; accordingly, we will collect reference observations of forest, non-forest, and forest disturbance. This will be demonstrated in three different tools that the user can choose from - AREA2, Collect Earth Desktop, and Collect Earth Online.

# 3.4 Response Design

## 1 Background

The response design defines the "response" of the units in a sample. In the context of design-based inference in a geographical context, "the response design encompasses all steps of the protocol that lead to a decision regarding agreement of the reference and map classifications and the best available classification of land surface conditions for each spatial unit sampled" (Olofsson et al. 2014). Of importance the following terms:

**Reference data**
Data characterizing the most accurate available assessment of the true condition at the sample location (example: fine-resolution satellite imagery).

**Reference observations**
The most accurate available assessment of the true condition of a population unit.

**Reference classification**
The reference classification applied to the collection of all sample units.

In this tutorial, we will determine reference conditions by examining a set of reference data at locations of the units of the sample that we drew from Colombia in the previous tutorial. We defined four strata: forest, non-forest, forest disturbance and a buffer around the forest disturbance. The objective is to estimate the area of forest disturbance; accordingly, we will collect reference observations of *forest, non-forest*, and *forest disturbance*. This will be demonstrated in three different tools that the user can choose from: AREA2, Collect Earth Desktop, and Collect Earth Online.
