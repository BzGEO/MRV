title: Response design
summary: This tutorial introduces the concept of response design, lists relevant terms, and highlights different tools that can be used for the collection of reference observations in the context of area estimation and map accuracy. More tutorials can be found here on OpenMRV under process "Sample data collection" and tools "GEE", "AREA2", "CE", and "CEO".

# Response Design

## 1 Background

The response design defines the "response" of the units in a sample. In the context of design-based inference in a geographical context, "the response design encompasses all steps of the protocol that lead to a decision regarding agreement of the reference and map classifications and the best available classification of land surface conditions for each spatial unit sampled" (Olofsson et al. 2014). Of importance the following terms:

**Reference data**
Data characterizing the most accurate available assessment of the true condition at the sample location (example: fine-resolution satellite imagery).

**Reference observations**
The most accurate available assessment of the true condition of a population unit.

**Reference classification**
The reference classification applied to the collection of all sample units.

Here on OpenMRV under "Sample data collection" and tools "GEE", "AREA2", "CE", and "CEO", you will find tutorials where you can learn how to determine reference conditions by examining a set of reference data at locations of the units of a sample dataset. This sample dataset will have four strata: forest, non-forest, forest disturbance and a buffer around the forest disturbance. The objective is to estimate the area of forest disturbance; accordingly, you will learn how to collect reference observations of *forest, non-forest*, and *forest disturbance*. This is demonstrated in three different tools that the user can choose from: GEE/AREA2, Collect Earth Desktop, and Collect Earth Online.
