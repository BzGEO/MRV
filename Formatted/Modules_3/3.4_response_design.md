title: Response design
summary: This tutorial introduces the concept of response design, lists relevant terms, and highlights different tools that can be used for the collection of reference observations in the context of area estimation and map accuracy. More tutorials can be found here on OpenMRV under process "Sample data collection" and tools "GEE", "AREA2", "CE", and "CEO".

# Response Design

## 1 Background

The response design defines the "response" of the units in a sample. In the context of design-based inference in a geographical context, "the response design encompasses all steps of the protocol that lead to a decision regarding agreement of the reference and map classifications and the best available classification of land surface conditions for each spatial unit sampled" (Olofsson et al. 2014). Of importance the following terms:

**Reference data**

Data characterizing the most accurate available assessment of the true condition at the sample location (example: fine-resolution satellite imagery).

**Reference observations**

The most accurate available assessment of the true condition of a population unit.

**Reference classification**

The reference classification applied to the collection of all sample units.

Additional terminology regarding sampling techniques can be found below in 1.2 Additional Terminology.

Here on OpenMRV under "Sample data collection" and tools "GEE", "AREA2", "CE", and "CEO", you will find tutorials where you can learn how to determine reference conditions by examining a set of reference data at locations of the units of a sample dataset. This sample dataset will have four strata: forest, non-forest, forest disturbance and a buffer around the forest disturbance. The objective is to estimate the area of forest disturbance; accordingly, you will learn how to collect reference observations of *forest, non-forest*, and *forest disturbance*. This is demonstrated in three different tools that the user can choose from: GEE/AREA2, Collect Earth Desktop, and Collect Earth Online.

## 1.2 Additional Terminology

**Response design** (similar definitions)

Defined by (Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998):  “The reference or ‘true’ classification is obtained for each sampling unit based on interpreting aerial photography or videography, a ground visit, or a combination of these sources. The methods used to determine this reference classification are called the ‘response design.’ The response design includes procedures to collect information pertaining to the reference land-cover determination, and rules for assigning one or more reference labels to each sampling unit.” Referred to as “measurement plan” by Särndal et al. (1992).

**Sample**

A subset of population units selected from the population.

**Sample design**

Synonymous with sampling design, which is the preferred term in the seminal literature (Cochran, 1977, Särndal et al., 1992). The term occurs in Rice (1995) who uses both “sampling design” and “sample design”. 

**Sampling design**

“The sampling design is the protocol by which the reference sample units are selected.” (Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998). “Sampling design” is also used by Cochran (1977) and Särndal et al. (1992) - the former also uses “sampling plan”. 

**Survey**

Särndal et al. (1992) defines a survey as a “partial investigation of a finite population”, and further that “that the terms ‘survey’ and ‘sample survey’ are used to denote statistical investigations with the following methodological features: [...] probability sampling [...] measurement plan [and] estimation”

**Survey design**

A “total survey design” defines the procedures for “obtaining the possible precision in the survey estimates while striking a balance between sampling and non-sampling errors [...] The survey design gives rise to survey operations” such as sample selection (Särndal et al., 1992). Lohr (1999) describes a total survey design as “A philosophy of survey design for minimizing nonsampling as well as sampling errors.” Also, in Lohr (1999) “survey design” is synonymous with sampling design.
