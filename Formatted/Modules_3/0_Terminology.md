# Terminology relevant to the sampling techniques

## 1 Background

A list of terms relevant to the sampling and inference techniques are provided in the AREA2 documentation: https://area2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/definitions.html  Below are a few additional terms not included in the AREA2 documentation.  

### 1.1 Response design
Defined by (Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998):  “The reference or ‘true’ classification is obtained for each sampling unit based on interpreting aerial photography or videography, a ground visit, or a combination of these sources. The methods used to determine this reference classification are called the ‘response design.’ The response design includes procedures to collect information pertaining to the reference land-cover determination, and rules for assigning one or more reference [labels] to each sampling unit.” Referred to as “measurement plan” by Särndal et al. (1992).

### 1.2 Sample
A subset of population units selected from the population.

### 1.3 Sample design
Synonymous with sampling design, which is the preferred term in the seminal literature (Cochran, 1977, Särndal et al., 1992). The term occurs in Rice (1995) who uses both “sampling design” and “sample design”. 

### 1.4 Sampling design
“The sampling design is the protocol by which the reference sample units are selected.” (Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998). “Sampling design” is also used by Cochran (1977) and Särndal et al. (1992) - the former also uses “sampling plan”. 

### 1.5 Survey
Särndal et al. (1992) defines a survey as a “partial investigation of a finite population”, and further that “that the terms ‘survey’ and ‘sample survey’ are used to denote statistical investigations with the following methodological features: [...] probability sampling [...] measurement plan [and] estimation”

### 1.6 Survey design
A “total survey design” defines the procedures for “obtaining the possible precision in the survey estimates while striking a balance between sampling and non-sampling errors [...] The survey design gives rise to survey operations” such as sample selection (Särndal et al., 1992). Lohr (1999) describes a total survey design as “A philosophy of survey design for minimizing nonsampling as well as sampling errors.” Also, in Lohr (1999) “survey design” is synonymous with sampling design.
